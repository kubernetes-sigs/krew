Krew is the package manager for kubectl plugins.

## What does Krew do?

Krew is a tool that makes it easy to use [kubectl
plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/). Krew
helps you discover plugins, install and manage them on your machine. It is
similar to tools like apt, dnf or [brew](https://brew.sh). Today, over [130
kubectl plugins][list] are available on Krew.

- **For kubectl users:** Krew helps you find, install and manage kubectl plugins
  in a consistent way.
- **For plugin developers:** Krew helps you package and distribute your plugins
  on multiple platforms and makes them discoverable.
